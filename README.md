# Machine Learning Bootcamp Final Project
## Hosted by DevTown in Collaboration with Google and Microsoft

Welcome to the Machine Learning Bootcamp Final Project repository! This project represents the culmination of our efforts during the 7-day workshop hosted by DevTown, in collaboration with Google and Microsoft.

## Introduction
In this project, we have developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices using the famous Boston Housing dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. We utilized various Python libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, to accomplish this task.

This workshop was made possible through the collaborative efforts of DevTown, Google, and Microsoft. It highlights the importance of shared knowledge and cross-industry collaboration in advancing machine learning and data science.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate our proficiency in machine learning techniques and showcase our ability to build, train, and evaluate predictive models, thanks to the collaborative effort of these esteemed organizations.

## Code Explanation
Here is an overview of the key components of the code:

1. **Data Loading**: We start by loading the Boston Housing dataset using scikit-learn's `load_boston` function.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the dataset by converting it into a pandas DataFrame and adding the target variable 'MEDV.' Additionally, we check for any missing values and ensure the data is ready for modeling.

3. **Train-Test Split**: We split the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function to facilitate model evaluation.

4. **Model Training**: We create a linear regression model using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class and train it using the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation - Training Set**: We calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the training set to assess how well the model fits the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation - Testing Set**: We calculate the RMSE for the testing set to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
